        <h2>I am Connor VanTress</h2>

        <p>My name is <b>Connor VanTress</b> and I am a freshmen at the <b>University of Missouri</b>. Here at the University of Missouri I 
        am pursuing a degree in IT. This is because the realm of technology is of huge interest to me. The ability to create nearly anything
        that one can imagine along with having the ability to bring whatever you create to market is very appealing to me. Not only that, but
        it can almost be considered a fact that technology will do nothing but grow as time goes on and I want to be a part of it.
